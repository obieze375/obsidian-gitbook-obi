Note : nice value can be between -20 to 19. Lesser the NICE value, more CPU resources will be used. Higher the nice value, less  

  

CPU attention will be given.  

  

  

Never run process with nice value of -20 ,CPU will give highest priority and no other jobs will be able to run.

# What to do if a process is locked

  
  

# STEP 1:  

  

~~~~

ps aux | grep -i apt  

  

  

sudo kill –9  

  

  

sudo killall apt apt-get

# STEP2:  

  

~~~~

lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock  

  

  

lsof /var/lib/apt/lists/lock  

  

  

lsof /var/cache/apt/archives/lock  

  

  

sudo kill -9 PID  

  

  

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock  

  

  

sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock  

  

  

sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock    

  

  

sudo dpkg --configure -a

# STEP3:  

  

Troubleshoot: dpkg: error: dpkg frontend is locked by another process

If you see the error “dpkg frontend is locked by another process” while running the above described method, you’ll have to do an additional step.

~~~~

First, find out the id of the process that is holding the lock file.

  

  

lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend

  

  

The above command will give you the PID of the processes using the lock files. Use this PID to kill the process.

  

sudo kill -9 PID

  

  

Now you can remove the lock and reconfigure dpkg:

  

sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend sudo dpkg --configure -a
