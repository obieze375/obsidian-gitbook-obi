# How to troubleshoot connectivity issues with mysql database

  

~~~

  · Check if IP has been given access the specific table and database  

  · Check if the internal firewall on the server is blocking a connection

  · Check if they have valid IP address  

  · Check if they can connect using localhost or DNS - To check if they have lost access to their DNS

  · stop, start, or restart the SQL Server service as needed using

  · access log files

# Troubleshooting ansible playbook ssh errors

  

~~~~

  

ssh -v <host_name>

  

playbook.yml -vvv -e <var>

  

Both above give better outputs in terms of useful info

  
  
  

~~~~

## SSH Errors

~~~~

permission denied -> points to failed ssh certificate signing -> check the ssh key/token, maybe it's stale and a new one needs to be generated

  

failed to connect -> Firewall/connectivity issue -> sshd or the whole server might be down

# How to Delete Old Files

  

• Delete using rm command

• Find files and then delete old files

  

Command Syntax

~~~~

• find /path/to/files/ -type f -name '*.jpg' -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;

~~~~

  

# Explanation

  

~~~~

• First part is the path where your files are located.

  

• Second part -type is the file type f stands for files

  

• Third part -name is for using the actual file names

  

• Fourth part -mtime gets how many days the files older then will be listed. +30 is for files older then 30 days.

  

• Fifth part -exec executes a command. In this case rm is the command, {} gets the filelist and \; closes the command

Memory (RAM)

• Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data

and machine code currently being used

  

• Swap (virtual memory)

  

• Memory carved out of a hard disk. It function just like RAM but it is slower

than RAM

  

• Cache

  

• This memory is typically integrated directly into the CPU chip or placed on a

separate chip that has a separate bus interconnect with the CPU. The purpose

of cache memory is to store program instructions and data that are used

repeatedly

# Can't ssh to an app Server:  

  

~~~~  

- Ping IP from localhost  

  

- Attempt to ssh from localhost  

- Ping IP from another node in the same/another domain  

  

- Attempt to ssh from that node to node in question  

~~~~

~~~~

If the previous 2 fail attempt to log into the server directly e.g. via ILO if it's a physical server like HP-UX series , or directly from Vsphere if a virtual server. If that issue fails, then it's need to be escalated to the infrastructure team/on site team of engineers to diagnose the issue further.  

~~~~

  

# Tip for diagnosing the issue:  

  

~~~~

Notify all the engineers and teams who have been working on the server and check if any of the changes they made could have caused the server's sshd capabilities to stop functioning. E.g. If a certain config file was edited, then revert the changes made to it and test and so forth  

~~~~

# Slowness on Server:

  

Check CPU, RAM, & Swap usage using top command  

  

~~~~

Based on the results the best option is to identify and kill PIDS that is causing the issue and if that is not resolution reboot the node and free up swap space as it doesn't get released after RAM usage goes down

# Troubleshooting Jenkins Build failures in pipeline

  

~~~~

 After locating the failed build do the following:

  

 Check the last build failure via the dashboard

  

 Check for any errors in the console output that might provide any further information via ctrl + f and search failed

  

 Check for recent bitbucket commits that were added prior to the build failure in outputs

  

 Search for commit in bitbucket and click on blame to find who made the commit, ask them in the change they made is correct

# To learn what a new or running process is doing

  

# Troubleshooting with strace

  

One of options of the strace utility is to help as a troubleshooting utility. If you want to know what a process is doing, or why it hangs, strace will definitely help. By running strace without any parameters, it will already show why a process is doing. You can trace a running process, or instruct strace to start it for you.

   ![](image/strace1.png)



  

# Monitoring file activity

  

Strace can monitor file related activity. There are two useful parts. The first is file, which shows file interactions. The other one allows tracing file descriptors. Both can be used to monitor for actions like opening files, reading/writing and closing. Usually using “trace=file” provides enough insights. If you really need more insights in the way a program deals with file descriptors, then use the second one.

  

# Monitor opening of files: strace -e open

  
  

# See all file activity:

  

~~~~

strace -e trace=file -p 1234  or

~~~~

  

~~~~

strace -e trace=desc -p 1234

~~~~

  

If you want to track specific paths, use 1 or more times the -P parameter, following by the path.

  

~~~~

sudo strace -P /etc/cups -p 2261

~~~~

  
  

~~~~

# Monitoring file access and activity with strace

  

# Monitoring the network

  

Strace definitely can be useful for revealing more details about network traffic. Very useful to determine what network related connections are used, like when building your Docker image.

  

~~~~

strace -e trace=network

~~~~

  
  

# Common syscalls:

  

~~~~

bind – link the process to a network port

  

listen – allow to receive incoming connections

  

socket – open a local or network socket

  

setsockopt – define options for an active socket

~~~~

  

# Monitoring memory calls

  

~~~~

To get better insights on the memory usage and system calls, strace can monitor for these as well. They are nicely grouped in the memory group.

# Strace Cheat Sheet – Overview

  
  

# Useful options and examples

  

~~~~

-c – See what time is spend and where (combine with -S for sorting)

  

-f – Track process including forked child processes

  

-o my-process-trace.txt – Log strace output to a file

  

-p 1234 – Track a process by PID

  

-P /tmp – Track a process when interacting with a path

  

-T – Display syscall duration in the output

# Track by specific system call group

  

~~~~

  

-e trace=ipc – Track communication between processes (IPC)

  

-e trace=memory – Track memory syscalls

  

-e trace=network – Track memory syscalls

  

-e trace=process – Track process calls (like fork, exec)

  

-e trace=signal – Track process signal handling (like HUP, exit)

  

-e trace=file – Track file related syscalls
