## Software and application firewalls

  

~~~~

The main difference between a hardware firewall and a software firewall is that the hardware firewall runs on its own physical device, while a software firewall is installed on another machine. A common example of a software firewall is the firewall built into most operating systems like Windows and macOS.

  

E.g. You can have the firewall config as physical controls the entire CORP env, while software protects specific applications
