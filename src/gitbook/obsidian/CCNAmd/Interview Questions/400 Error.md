What Is a 400 Bad Request?

A 400 Bad Request error means that the request the client made is incorrect or corrupt, and the server can't understand it. 

The main thing to understand is that the 400 error is a client-side error. It indicates that the request the client submitted can't be processed by the server. 

In rare cases, it can be a problem with the server that's causing the error.
